          access, and sap:// for the SDP to be announced via SAP.
      --sout-rtp-mux=<string>    Muxer
          This allows you to specify the muxer used for the streaming output.
          Default is to use no muxer (standard RTP stream).

          Announce this session with SAP.
      --sout-rtp-name=<string>   Session name
          This is the name of the session that will be announced in the SDP
          (Session Descriptor).
      --sout-rtp-cat=<string>    Session category
          This allows you to specify a category for the session, that will be
          announced if you choose to use SAP.
      --sout-rtp-description=<string> 
                                 Session description
          This allows you to give a short description with details about the
          stream, that will be announced in the SDP (Session Descriptor).
      --sout-rtp-url=<string>    Session URL
          This allows you to give a URL with more details about the stream
          (often the website of the streaming organization), that will be
          announced in the SDP (Session Descriptor).
      --sout-rtp-email=<string>  Session email
          This allows you to give a contact mail address for the stream, that
          will be announced in the SDP (Session Descriptor).
      --sout-rtp-proto={dccp,sctp,tcp,udp,udplite} 
                                 Transport protocol
          This selects which transport protocol to use for RTP.
      --sout-rtp-port=<integer>  Port
          This allows you to specify the base port for the RTP streaming.
      --sout-rtp-port-audio=<integer> 
                                 Audio port
          This allows you to specify the default audio port for the RTP
          streaming.
      --sout-rtp-port-video=<integer> 
                                 Video port
          This allows you to specify the default video port for the RTP
          streaming.
      --sout-rtp-ttl=<integer>   Hop limit (TTL)
          This is the hop limit (also known as "Time-To-Live" or TTL) of the
          multicast packets sent by the stream output (-1 = use operating
          system built-in default).
      --sout-rtp-rtcp-mux, --no-sout-rtp-rtcp-mux 
                                 RTP/RTCP multiplexing
                                 (default disabled)
          This sends and receives RTCP packet multiplexed over the same port as
          RTP packets.
      --sout-rtp-caching=<integer> 
                                 Caching value (ms)
          Default caching value for outbound RTP streams. This value should be
          set in milliseconds.
      --sout-rtp-key=<string>    SRTP key (hexadecimal)
          RTP packets will be integrity-protected and ciphered with this Secure
          RTP master shared secret key. This must be a 32-character-long
          hexadecimal string.
      --sout-rtp-salt=<string>   SRTP salt (hexadecimal)
          Secure RTP requires a (non-secret) master salt value. This must be a
          28-character-long hexadecimal string.
      --sout-rtp-mp4a-latm, --no-sout-rtp-mp4a-latm 
                                 MP4A LATM
                                 (default disabled)
          This allows you to stream MPEG4 LATM audio streams (see RFC3016).
      --rtsp-timeout=<integer>   RTSP session timeout (s)
          RTSP sessions will be closed after not receiving any RTSP request for
          this long. Setting it to a negative value or zero disables timeouts.
          The default is 60 (one minute).
      --sout-rtsp-user=<string>  Username
          Username that will be requested to access the stream.
      --sout-rtsp-pwd=<string>   Password
